pygame install instructions
https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

If you are running macos and run into errors during installation, check this out:
        https://www.pygame.org/wiki/MacCompile
        if you're running macos, and followed those instructions, and still had trouble, try this:
        
        Use python 3.7.6
        
        In terminal:
        pip3 install --upgrade pip
        pip3 install pygame
        You can get python 3.7.6 from python.org.
        You can test which version of python you're running by typing "python3 -V" into terminal
        If this still doesn't work, feel free to send me a msg
        on facebook or slack, I'm Anthony Asp.

If you are running windows and run into trouble with installation, 
google around and feel free to send me a msg.
windows is not my expertise.
